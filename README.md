# <Full Stack - prework study guide>

## Description


-My reason for creating this study guide was to make the Full Stack web development class easier to understand by creating
a place to be able to go back and re-read the fundamentals of coding. Where as beginning to learn something new can be rather difficult, understanding the basics of anything you are learning creates a foundation for you to be able to build upon,  giving you more confidence in your ability(in this case) to learn the language of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Here we have four different sections. Each focusing on a different language. HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. You can go into whichever section you like and learn about the specific language. You can also use DevTools go into Console and see the JavaScript running and get an idea on what to study first.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
